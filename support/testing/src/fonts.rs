//! Fonts built in memory, and the collections the crate's tests set text in.
//!
//! A test written against a font the machine happens to have is a test of
//! the machine. Ahem is vendored for that reason; beside it these are built
//! from a description, carrying the tables the stages read and nothing else:
//! a Unicode cmap for coverage, `name` for the family, `head`, `hhea`, `OS/2`
//! and `post` for the metrics, `maxp` and `hmtx` so that a shaper can read
//! them, a `COLR` header where the font is to count as a color font, `GSUB`
//! and `GPOS` where the shaper is to substitute or move something:
//! ligatures, Arabic joining forms, a character drawn as two glyphs, a glyph
//! drawn raised, a kerning pair, a form one language system asks for, a
//! feature's alternate glyphs, directly or only through a contextual lookup;
//! `fvar` and `HVAR` where the font varies,
//! its axes moving every advance; `trak`, with the `STAT` HarfBuzz asks
//! for beside it, where the font tracks by the point size it is set at; and
//! `vhea`, `vmtx` and `VORG` where it has vertical metrics.
//! Deterministic, and in every build: no file, no licence.
//!
//! Shared by the crate's unit tests and its integration tests, so it names
//! nothing of the crate's, only fontwich's, and by a crate that is `no_std`
//! when its tests run without default features, so it names `alloc` rather
//! than `std`.
