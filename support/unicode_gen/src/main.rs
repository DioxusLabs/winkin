//! Generates `crates/winkin/src/unicode/tables.rs`.
//!
//! Run it from anywhere in the workspace, then format what it wrote:
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo run --release -p unicode_gen
//! cargo fmt
//! ```
//!
//! The file is committed. Running both again reproduces it byte for byte;
//! winkin's sweep test (`unicode/tests.rs`) checks it against `icu_properties`
//! for every character.
//!
//! # Why a packed table
//!
//! Analysis asks for a handful of properties of every character. Asking
//! `icu_properties` means one trie or inversion list per property, and above
//! U+0FFF an out-of-line call and four to six dependent loads for each trie:
//! about ten times what one packed lookup costs (research `icu4x-text.md` §6).
//! So everything is packed into two `u32` words per code point, each a
//! three-level packtab lookup with no slow path: three dependent loads in
//! every plane.
//!
//! # The core word
//!
//! Read for every character by the analysis loop.

//! | Bits | Field |
//! |---:|---|
//! | 0 | Joining_Type = Join_Causing |
//! | 1 | East_Asian_Width = Wide or Fullwidth |
//! | 2 | Vertical_Orientation = U, Tu or Tr: upright in a vertical line under `text-orientation: mixed` |
//! | 3 | Line_Break = CJ |
//! | 4 | Line_Break = GL, WJ or ZWJ: glue |
//! | 5 | Emoji_Modifier_Base |
//! | 6 | Emoji_Component |
//! | 7 | Default_Ignorable_Code_Point |
//! | 8..12 | Grapheme_Cluster_Break, ICU4C's numbering with ZWJ moved to 13 |
//! | 12..14 | Indic_Conjunct_Break, ICU4C's numbering |
//! | 14..17 | East Asian spacing: 0 other, 1 narrow, 2 narrow digit, 3 conditional, 4 wide, 5 a mark |
//! | 17..21 | the text-spacing class: Blink's `HanKerningCharType`, 0 to 10 |
//! | 21..24 | the emphasis class: 0 marked, 1 a space, 2 punctuation, 3 a symbol, 4 never marked |
//! | 24..26 | the first-letter class: 0 other, 1 a space, 2 opening punctuation or a dash, 3 other punctuation |
//! | 26..32 | zero |
//!
//! Joining_Type, East_Asian_Width, Vertical_Orientation and the glue classes
//! were each a field of their own until the simplification wave
//! (2026-09-29), ten bits in all, where every stage reads each as the one
//! question its bit now answers: a join-causing character that letter
//! spacing sees through, a wide character `text-emphasis-skip: narrow`
//! marks, an upright one under `text-orientation: mixed`, and a character
//! that glues an atomic inline to its neighbour.
//!
//! Emoji_Modifier_Base, Emoji_Component and Indic_Conjunct_Break are
//! reserved for an in-house grapheme segmenter, written only if measurement
//! argues for one. They are filled now so that the table does
//! not change shape when it is. Until a stage reads them only the sweep test
//! does, so the constants of the three are compiled for the tests alone.
//! Line_Break = SA is read by word motion, which
//! segments a run of it whole, as ICU's word segmenter hands
//! such a run to its dictionary or model. The mark bit is read by font
//! coverage, which replays harfrust's normalizer against a font: a mark is
//! what that normalizer clusters with the character before it, and what it
//! composes onto a starter. The Emoji bit is read by font
//! selection, which applies `font-variant-emoji` to an Emoji character as
//! Chrome does (`Character::IsEmoji`), and to no other.
//!
//! # East Asian spacing
//!
//! What `text-autospace` reads: UTR #59's East_Asian_Spacing,
//! derived here as Chrome 153 derives it for its own table
//! (`character_property_data_generator.cc`, `SetEastAsianSpacing`), since
//! ICU carries no such property yet. Wide: Script Bopomofo, Han, Hangul,
//! Hiragana, Katakana, Khitan Small Script, Nushu, Tangut or Yi, or a
//! Script_Extensions naming one of them where East_Asian_Width is neither
//! Neutral nor Narrow; less what is East_Asian_Width Halfwidth, punctuation,
//! Other_Number, or a symbol other than a modifier symbol; plus U+3013.
//! Conditional: Other_Punctuation not Fullwidth, Halfwidth or Wide, less
//! eight listed characters. Narrow: letters, marks and decimal digits not
//! Fullwidth, Halfwidth or Wide, less what is Wide. Unassigned code points are
//! other. Two values are this crate's own: a Narrow decimal digit is kept
//! apart from a letter, for `ideograph-numeric` beside `ideograph-alpha`; and
//! every mark (General_Category M), which Chrome's autospace loop steps over
//! before it classifies anything, is 5 whatever the derivation says.
//!
//! # Text-spacing classes
//!
//! What `text-spacing-trim` reads: CSS Text 4's text spacing
//! classes as Blink numbers them (`HanKerningCharType`, set in
//! `SetHanKerning`): other 0, opening 1, closing 2, middle 3, a narrow opening
//! bracket 4, a narrow closing one 5, and the five whose class depends on the
//! font -- the dots 6, the colon 7, the semicolon 8, the opening quotes 9 and
//! the closing quotes 10. An opening or closing bracket (General_Category Ps
//! or Pe) is full width in the CJK Symbols and Punctuation block
//! (U+3000-303F) or where it is East_Asian_Width Fullwidth, and narrow
//! otherwise.
//!
//! # Emphasis classes
//!
//! What `text-emphasis-skip` reads: which kinds of
//! character a mark is not set over. 4, never marked: controls (Cc), format
//! characters (Cf), unassigned code points (Cn) and the line and paragraph
//! separators (Zl, Zp). 1, a space: the space separators (Zs) and the word
//! separators Chrome lists beside them (`Character::CanReceiveTextEmphasis`:
//! U+1361, U+10100, U+10101, U+1039F, U+0F0B, U+0F0C). 2, punctuation:
//! General_Category P, less the characters CSS Text Decoration 4 marks
//! anyway (`#`, `%`, `&`, `@`, `§`, `¶`, the per mille and per ten thousand
//! signs, the Arabic percent signs, U+204A, U+204B, U+2053, U+303D, and their
//! small and fullwidth forms), which Chrome lists too. 3, a symbol:
//! General_Category S. Everything else, 0, takes a mark. Skipping the
//! initial `spaces punctuation` is Chrome's rule exactly.
//!
//! # First-letter classes
//!
//! What `::first-letter` reads to find where its text ends,
//! CSS Pseudo-Elements 4 §2.2.1's categories as Blink's
//! `FirstLetterPseudoElement` tests them: 1, a space separator (Zs) other
//! than U+3000 IDEOGRAPHIC SPACE, which may come between the punctuation and
//! the letter; 2, opening punctuation (Ps) or a dash (Pd), which may come
//! before the letter only; 3, the rest of the punctuation (Pc, Pe, Pi, Pf,
//! Po), which may come on either side of it. Everything else is 0.
//!
//! # Numbering
//!
//! The numbers are ICU4C's, baked into the generated file, except where a
//! field is too narrow for them. ICU4X is removing the conversions that read
//! ICU4C's values, so each property is mapped here by a `match` on its named
//! values instead. The match is also the check that winkin's enums agree:
//! a value added to Unicode fails here, loudly, rather than being packed as
//! something else. Script values are read from ICU's conversion while it
//! exists; the generated file records the answer, so its removal costs a new
//! mapping, never correctness.
//!
//! Grapheme_Cluster_Break is the one field that departs. ICU4C numbers ZWJ 17,
//! after four values Unicode has assigned to no character since 11.0. Four
//! bits hold 0 to 15, so ZWJ is 13 here and the four are refused.
//!
//! # The paragraph separator
//!
//! Line_Break BK, CR, LF or NL: LF, VT, FF, CR, NEL, U+2028 and U+2029. These
//! are UAX #14's mandatory breaks, so a forced line break and a bidi paragraph
//! end coincide. CRLF is one break, but that is segmentation's
//! business. U+001C to U+001E are bidi class B but not line breaks, and are
//! left out until a Chrome probe says otherwise.
//!
//! # Scripts
//!
//! The ten-bit field copies ICU's `ScriptWithExtensions` encoding, narrowed.
//! ICU spends two more bits saying whether the script is Common, Inherited or
//! another; here there are none to spend, so:
//!
//! - a value below `SCRIPT_COUNT` is a script, and the character's
//!   Script_Extensions is that script alone;
//! - a value at or above it names set `value - SCRIPT_COUNT`, whose run in
//!   `SCRIPT_RUNS` is the character's Script and then its Script_Extensions.
//!   ICU stores the script first in the same way for its "other" case; here
//!   every set does, Common and Inherited included.
//!
//! One set exists per distinct pair of Script and Script_Extensions.
//! `SCRIPT_RUNS` begins with every script alone, in value order, so that a
//! plain script's extensions are a one-element slice of it.
//!
//! # Brackets
//!
//! A pair id and an "opens" bit rather than the closing character: Unicode 17
//! has 64 bracket pairs, 63 once the equivalent ones below are merged, so
//! seven bits hold an id plus one with room to double, where a character would
//! need sixteen and a presence bit. `BRACKET_CLOSINGS` maps the id back.
//!
//! Rule N0 matches a closing bracket to an opener by Bidi_Paired_Bracket "or
//! its canonical equivalent" (UAX #9 BD16). The only brackets with canonical
//! decompositions are U+2329 and U+232A, to U+3008 and U+3009. So both pairs
//! get one id, whose closing character is U+3009, and N0 compares ids with no
//! special case.
//!
//! # The lookups
//!
//! packtab's three-lookup solution, rendered here rather than by packtab:
//! packtab reads its arrays with `[]`, and winkin allows no panic that a
//! caller's input could reach. Every read goes through `at`, which answers
//! zero past the end of its array. No index the lookups compute is past the
//! end; the sweep test visits every character to show it.
