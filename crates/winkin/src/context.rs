//! stages borrow one cache and scratch at a time ([`Context::analyzing`] and

//!
//! Every cache keeps at most its capacity ([`CacheLimits`]).
//! [`Context::start_build`] and [`Context::start_break`] trim the caches to

//! layout holds none, and a call holds its ids only while it runs. They also
//! release scratch far bigger than the last calls needed.
