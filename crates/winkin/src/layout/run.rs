//! Text runs: a text item read back with its font, its glyphs and its
//! clusters.
//!
//! **A run's font is its shaping run's.** A text item holds clusters of one
//! used font, and names the shaping run of its first shaped cluster, whose
//! font that is. The used font holds what a renderer draws with: the font's
//! shared bytes, its index, its coordinates and its synthesis. Font
//! selection copies these from the context's instance. So a layout is read
//! without the context, and [`TextRun::font`] borrows the layout alone.
//!
//! **Glyphs are decoded on the fly** by `fragments::GlyphWalk`. It yields the
//! paragraph's glyphs, and the line's own at its reshaped edges, in drawing
//! order and placed exactly. This file converts them to pixels. Nothing is
//! allocated and nothing restarts.
