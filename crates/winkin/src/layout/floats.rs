//! Floats read back: which the lines reached, and where the host put each.
//!
//! The host places floats; this reports what it was asked and how it
//! answered. Each record is the float's margin box as the content has it, at
//! the line-left and block-start edges the host gave, in the coordinates the
//! lines were broken in. A host that tracks its own floats knows this
//! already. A host that answers with [`NoExclusions`](crate::NoExclusions)
//! puts each float where its line reaches it and forgets it, so it reads here
//! where to draw each.
