//! Left and right motion on the screen, by character, by word and to a line's ends.
//!
//! Within a line where text reads one way, screen order follows text order,
//! reversed in a right-to-left paragraph. "One way" means every cluster
//! crossed, and one either side, is at the paragraph's base level and none
//! is combined text.
//! So a motion is first found in text order, and only text that changes
//! direction, or crosses an RTL line edge, is walked on the screen.
//!
//! - By character, a step goes to the nearest caret stop on the line the way
//!   the arrow points. Stops are ordered by leaf as drawn, then by cluster
//!   within the leaf, so both sides of a zero-width character stay separate
//!   stops. Past the line's edge, right continues onto the next line and
//!   left onto the previous line.
//! - Character motion's rules hold. A builder break opportunity's two sides
//!   are one stop. Every stop is downstream, except at combined text's edge,
//!   where the affinity chooses the caret's side.
//! - At a leaf's edge, a position is a stop only where its caret is drawn
//!   there. A position drawn where the caret already is, across a change of
//!   direction, is passed over; the arrow would not move the caret.
//! - By word, character steps repeat until one lands where a text-order word
//!   motion would stop, read the way the landing run reads. Going the way
//!   the run reads, [`WordMotion`] decides; against it, the stop is a word's
//!   start. So a right-to-left run swaps a word's halves, and a caret leaving
//!   Arabic for the Latin after it does not skip a word.
//! - Two positions drawn at one place across a change of direction are one
//!   word stop. A word motion stops there where either would.
//! - A line end that no position draws its caret at is not reached. That is
//!   the far side of a run against the paragraph, which Chrome draws on the
//!   paragraph's side. A motion that finds no stop ends at the last one it
//!   reached.
//! - Inside a leaf a step follows text order, so a word crossed costs its
//!   length. Each leaf edge costs a walk of its line.
//! - To a line's end, the motion goes to the edge of the leaf drawn there.
//!   Where that edge is the line's logical end or start, it is End or Home in
//!   text order. Elsewhere it is the position a point past that end hits.
//! - An arrow collapses a selection to the end drawn further that way, where
//!   both ends are at two places on one line. Elsewhere it collapses to the
//!   end the paragraph's direction maps the arrow to, as Chrome does.
