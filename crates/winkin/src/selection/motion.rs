//! Caret and selection motion, as Chrome's `SelectionModifier` moves, measured in Chrome 153.
//!
//! Everything here moves in text order. Left and right by character, by word
//! and to a line's ends go on the screen, in `visual`. Line, paragraph and
//! document motion have no screen side. There left and right go by the
//! focus paragraph's direction, as Chrome's `ModifyMovingRight` is
//! `ModifyMovingForward` in a left-to-right paragraph.
//!
//! - By character: a stop at each grapheme cluster boundary. A grapheme split
//!   by a style boundary is one, unless a box's edge parts it. A builder
//!   break opportunity's two sides are one stop, as Chrome skips a `<wbr>`.
//!   Every stop is downstream. At a wrap after a space, a caret stops at the
//!   line end before the space and the next line's start after it. At a wrap
//!   inside a word, it stops only at the next line's start.
//! - By word: forward to the next word's start past the spaces (Windows) or
//!   to its end (macOS and Linux), backward to a word's start everywhere, as
//!   Blink's `NextWordPositionForPlatform`. Words are UAX #29's over each
//!   whole paragraph. The motion steps character stops until one starts or
//!   ends a word, asking `words` in place, so it costs the distance it moves.
//!   A forced break is a stop of its own.
//! - By line: to the position the next line hits at the starting column,
//!   which the selection keeps across short lines, as Blink's
//!   `x_pos_for_vertical_arrow_navigation`. Past the last line it goes to the
//!   text's end; before the first, to its start.
//! - To a line's ends, logically, as Chrome's Home and End go. Home goes to
//!   the line's first offset. End goes to the end of what the line placed,
//!   before white space a wrap removed, or after the first preserved space
//!   hanging past it, as Blink's `AdjustForSoftLineWrap`. End reaches into
//!   text an ellipsis hides, as in Chrome. An editable block's
//!   `-webkit-line-break: after-white-space` is Chrome's editing, not CSS, and
//!   is not matched.
