//! Text placement along curves, matching SVG `textPath`.
//!
//! Break lines normally, then map their paint operations onto a path.
//! Wrapping, justification, hyphenation, ellipses, bidi order and annotations
//! use the same layout as straight lines. The mapping does not modify layout.
//!
//! [`PathRoom`] supplies each line with its path length minus a start offset.
//! It uses line indices, so repeated fitting or balancing selects the same
//! path. [`paints`] positions characters at their advance midpoints and
//! rotates each character as a unit, preserving offsets between base glyphs
//! and marks (SVG 2, section 11.8.3).
//!
//! The path is the alphabetic baseline for horizontal lines and the central
//! baseline for vertical lines. Vertical upright and combined glyphs stand
//! across the path, with their top toward its start. Combined text retains
//! [`TextRun::combine_scale`](crate::TextRun::combine_scale).
//!
//! Hyphens, ellipses, ruby, emphasis and atomic inlines follow the path.
//! Decorations are split per character, matching SVG and Chrome.
//! Backgrounds and borders are omitted. The host places floats.
//!
//! [`PastEnds::Hidden`] omits characters with midpoints outside the path;
//! [`PastEnds::Straight`] extends the endpoint tangents. Closed paths do not
//! wrap back to the start, matching current browsers rather than SVG 2.
//!
//! SVG `side="right"` maps to [`ReversedPath`], `startOffset` to [`PathRoom`],
//! and `text-anchor` to line alignment. Placement uses `method="align"` and
//! `spacing="exact"`. Renderers can implement stretched outlines or smooth
//! decorations using [`TextPath::point`].
//!
//! Implement [`TextPath`] with an existing curve library, or use [`Polyline`]
//! and [`BezierPath`] with supplied measurement buffers. These operations
//! do not allocate.
