//! Text on path tests. They pin:
//! - a straight path placing every glyph where the straight line does;
//! - a path turning each character the way it runs at the character's
//!   middle, its glyphs as one, and leaving out what is past its ends;
//! - each line as long as its own path, however often the breaker asks;
//! - upright text across a path, sideways text along it, and combined text
//!   narrowed along it;
//! - annotations, marks, decorations, atomic inlines and the ellipsis
//!   following the text;
//! - a path running on past its ends and backward;
//! - nothing a path or a buffer answers panicking.
//!
//! The figures are in Ahem: every glyph an em square, 0.8 of it over the
//! baseline.
