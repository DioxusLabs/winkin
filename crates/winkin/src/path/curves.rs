//! Polyline and cubic Bézier paths without a curve-library dependency.
//!
//! Arc lengths are measured into supplied buffers, so neither path allocates.
//! Distance queries use binary search over corners or curve samples. Reuse
//! measurements with `from_measured` when drawing a path again.
//!
//! Short buffers include only the content they can hold. Nonfinite points
//! contribute no length or rotation. A zero-length path is a point with
//! a rightward tangent. Invalid input does not panic.
