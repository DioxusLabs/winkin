//! A line's paint placed along a path.
//!
//! Each thing [`Line::paints`] yields, in Chrome's order, turns to the path
//! where its character's middle falls.
//!
//! **Read, not recomputed.** A run's start along the line is its own
//! [`inline`](TextRun::inline), and a glyph's place is its own `x` and `y`.
//! Marks and decorations go where the paint puts them. The only thing worked
//! out here is each character's middle, from its glyphs' advances, since that
//! is where it turns.
//!
//! **A character turns as one** (SVG 2, section 11.8.3, and Blink's
//! `SvgTextLayoutAlgorithm::PositionOnPath`). A cluster's glyphs share a text
//! offset and turn about the cluster's middle, so a mark keeps its offset from
//! its base across a bend. A ligature is one character. Combined text is one
//! character, turning about its em's middle.
//!
//! **Read once, nothing held.** Each glyph comes with where its cluster
//! starts along the line and how far it reaches, which the run's glyph
//! walk knows exactly as it places the glyph, so a character's middle is
//! found at its first glyph, with no look ahead, and a cluster that takes
//! room and draws nothing still moves the characters after it.
//!
//! **Each run a walk of its own.** A text run is handed out as a view
//! ([`PathTextRun`]) whose [`glyphs`](PathTextRun::glyphs) walk its placed
//! glyphs, as [`TextRun::glyphs`] walks them along a straight line, so a
//! renderer takes the run's font once and walks its glyphs in a loop of its
//! own; and a decoration as a view ([`PathDecoration`]) whose
//! [`pieces`](PathDecoration::pieces) walk it.
