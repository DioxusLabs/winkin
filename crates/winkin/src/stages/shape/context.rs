//! The shaping caches and scratch that outlive a layout.
//!
//! Everything here is a cache, keyed by content: a font and its
//! coordinates, a script, a direction, a language, a list of features.
//! Nothing is keyed by a width, a first-line cut or a layout's ids. A call
//! shapes in the layout's own used-font record ([`UsedInstance`]), which
//! holds the whole font. Lookups use that record's [`FontKey`] and
//! coordinates, and a miss rebuilds the entry from it. So any entry may be
//! dropped between calls, and a reshape never finds another font's data.
//! Each cache keeps at most its capacity: [`ShapeContext::trim`] drops the
//! entries used longest ago between calls. An id lives for one shaping
//! call, so none is held then.
//!
//! The caches:
//! - **languages**: harfrust's [`Language`] per [`PlanLanguage`], since
//!   building a tag longer than eight bytes allocates.
//! - **plans**: a [`ShapePlan`] per font, feature variations, script,
//!   direction, language and features. Without one, harfrust compiles a plan
//!   on every call, which dominates shaping a short run.
//! - **trim fonts**: what a font says to `text-spacing-trim` ([`TrimFont`]),
//!   per instance, language and direction, read once from its tables and ten
//!   probe characters.
//! - **vertical metrics** ([`VerticalFont`], [`VerticalGlyphs`]): each
//!   glyph's advance and origin down the line, read once per glyph (see
//!   `vertical`).
//!
//! The scratch, which keeps its capacity:
//! - **call buffers** ([`CallBuffers`]): the converted features and one
//!   harfrust [`Buffer`].
//! - **trim marks** ([`TrimMarks`]): a call's marks, passed to harfrust as
//!   `halt` over each mark's range. A plan compiled with one such range
//!   serves a call with any number, since harfrust sets ranged masks per
//!   call.
//!
//! Warm, a call finds each entry by hash and allocates nothing. A plan's
//! hash names its language by the language table's id, and its match
//! compares the language itself, so a language dropped and its id reused
//! never finds another language's plan. A table whose ids are all taken
//! (four billion live entries) starts again rather than panicking.
