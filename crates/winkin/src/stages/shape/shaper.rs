//! The one shaping function, and the only code that calls harfrust.
//!
//! The shaping pass calls [`shape_range`] once per shaping run, with a
//! [`GlyphSink`] over the shaped text's tables. The breaker calls it per
//! unsafe line edge, with a sink over the line's own. Because there is one
//! function, a reshaped edge differs from the paragraph's shaping only at
//! the break itself. The key, the context either side, the glyph-to-cluster
//! mapping and the encoding are all the same.
//!
//! **Glyphs to clusters.** harfrust returns glyphs in visual order, each
//! labelled with the byte its cluster starts at. Walked in the text's order
//! (backwards for right-to-left), the labels never decrease. So one forward
//! cursor finds each glyph's cluster, and each cluster's glyphs are one
//! contiguous slice of the output, in visual order. A cluster no glyph lands
//! on lies inside something the shaper merged, such as a ligature. If it
//! follows glyphs, it is a continuation. Where a merge ends inside a later
//! cluster, the clusters up to that one's end are merged whole, as Chrome's
//! grapheme cluster level merges them. Letter-spacing then goes once after
//! them, as in Chrome's `ShapeResult::ApplySpacing`.
//!
//! **Unsafe bits.** harfrust flags whether a break at a glyph's cluster
//! start changes the shaping. A cluster takes the flag of the glyph labelled
//! at its start. A cluster with no such glyph lies inside a merged one, and
//! is unsafe. The first cluster shaped is a start, so it keeps no bit.
//! Instead, harfrust's flag for it is returned, for the breaker's reshape
//! window.
//!
//! **Punctuation trim** (`text-spacing-trim`). For each call, the rule in
//! `trim` finds the marks that give their blanks back, from the characters
//! either side. The font's `halt` applies over each mark's own bytes, as in
//! Chrome's `HanKerning`. Where a mark is kerned against what precedes it,
//! breaking before it is unsafe, as Chrome marks it, so a line starting
//! there is reshaped as a start.
//!
//! This holds for a shaping run's first cluster too, which is kerned against
//! the run before. Its word says a break is unsafe, not that a reshape
//! cannot start there, since the runs are shaped apart. Where the font has
//! no `halt` and the config asks for it, the mark's advance is halved
//! instead, which Chrome does not do.
