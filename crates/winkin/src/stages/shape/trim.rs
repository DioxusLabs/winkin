//! `text-spacing-trim` at shaping: which full-width punctuation gives back
//! its blank half, and how.
//!
//! The rule is Chrome's shaper's, `HanKerning` (Blink's `han_kerning.cc`).
//! It is read in Chrome 153's source and measured there with Yu Gothic,
//! which has `halt`, and MS Gothic, which does not.
//! - Under any value but `space-all`, every font shapes with `chws`, which
//!   font selection turns on. A font with contextual half-width spacing
//!   collapses adjacent punctuation itself.
//! - Where the font has `halt`, this module finds the pairs the text spacing
//!   classes make. The font's `halt` applies to each mark that gives its
//!   blank back, one character's range at a time. An opening mark kerns
//!   after an opening, middle or closing mark, or a narrow opening bracket
//!   ([`should_kern`]). A closing mark kerns before a closing, middle or
//!   narrow closing mark ([`should_kern_last`]).
//! - Where the font also has `chws`, it handles pairs inside a run itself,
//!   and only the run's edges are found here.
//! - The characters either side of a run are the text's, across items and
//!   fonts. In Yu Gothic at 40px, `漢」<span>」</span>漢` is 140px wide, the
//!   same as `漢」」漢`, even with the second mark in another font. A
//!   neighbour whose class depends on the font takes it from the font it
//!   is shaped in ([`class_beside`]), so a dot in one fallback font kerns
//!   before a colon in another.
//! - A kerned mark is unsafe to break before, so a line breaking inside a
//!   pair reshapes. A line starting at an opening mark is shaped as a start
//!   and takes nothing from before it: `漢」「漢` broken between the marks
//!   sets the `「` whole at the next line's start.
//! - Where the font has no `halt`, nothing is trimmed: MS Gothic sets
//!   `漢「「漢` at 160px. [`Config::punctuation_trim`] set to
//!   [`PunctuationTrim::Always`] trims there too, which Chrome does not. It
//!   halves the mark's own advance, as Chrome's unshipped fallback
//!   (`ApplyKerning`) does. An opening mark's glyph moves back into the half
//!   it keeps.
//! - Five classes depend on the font: its dots, colon, semicolon and curly
//!   quotes. They are read once from its glyphs ([`TrimFont`]), by which
//!   half of the advance each glyph's ink is in, as shaped in the text's
//!   language.
//! - At a line's start, a paragraph under `trim-start` trims its opening
//!   mark ([`ShapingEdges::trim_start`]). So does every wrapped line under
//!   `space-first` or `trim-start`, which the breaker reshapes.
//! - At a line's end, a closing mark that fits only when trimmed is trimmed,
//!   and the breaker reshapes it too ([`ShapingEdges::trim_end`]).
//!
