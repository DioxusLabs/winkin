//! A font's vertical metrics as Chrome hands them to its shaper, for upright
//! text in a vertical line.
//!
//! Blink does not let HarfBuzz read vertical metrics itself. It answers the
//! vertical advance and origin from its own reading of the tables
//! (`OpenTypeVerticalData`, called from `HarfBuzzFace`'s
//! `HarfBuzzGetGlyphVerticalAdvance` and `…Origin`). The two readings differ
//! wherever a font lacks a table. So a call shaping down the line gives
//! harfrust these answers instead (`harfrust::FontFuncs`), at the call's
//! size:
//! - **Advance**: `vmtx`'s, scaled by size over em, where the font has
//!   `vhea` and `vmtx`. Otherwise the font's line height, its ascent and
//!   descent each rounded to a whole pixel (Blink's `height_fallback_`).
//! - **Origin across**: half the glyph's `hmtx` advance.
//! - **Origin up**: `VORG`'s, using its default for unlisted glyphs and
//!   glyph 0. Without `VORG`, the glyph's bounds' top, rounded out to a
//!   whole pixel as Skia does, plus its top side bearing. Without `vmtx`
//!   either, the font's ascent.
//! - Every value is a float in pixels truncated to 16.16, as
//!   `SkiaScalarToHarfBuzzPosition` does. Like Blink, this reads `hmtx`,
//!   `vmtx` and `VORG` raw, without `HVAR` or `VVAR`.
//!
//! Everything else harfrust asks (glyphs, horizontal advances, extents) is
//! its own, scaled by its own dispatch. Horizontal text keeps harfrust's own
//! functions entirely.
//!
//! A glyph's two answers depend only on its instance, the size and the
//! fallback. So the context caches a [`VerticalFont`] per instance at a size
//! and a [`VerticalGlyph`] per glyph asked ([`VerticalGlyphs`]), as Blink
//! keeps vertical data with the font at its size. A call reads the tables
//! ([`VerticalTables`]) only at the first glyph the cache lacks, so a warm
//! call reads none. That matters because, without `VORG`, a `CFF` or `gvar`
//! font draws the outline to find a glyph's bounds.
