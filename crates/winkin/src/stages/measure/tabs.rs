//! Tab stops: the one function a tab is sized by.
//!
//! A tab's width depends on where it starts on its line, so the prefix gives
//! it none. The intrinsic sizes, the breaker and line layout each size it
//! with [`tab_advance_reached`], so what the breaker fits is what line layout
//! places. A ruby column's overhang may reach into a tab ([`TabReach`]).
//!
//! The rule is Chrome's `Font::TabWidth`:
//! - Stops are multiples of `tab-size` from the block's content edge.
//! - A `tab-size` in spaces counts the block container's space: its primary
//!   font's U+0020 with its letter-spacing and word-spacing, as Chrome's
//!   `LineBreaker` sizes a tab in `InlineNode::FontForTab`. The count is the
//!   tab's own style's.
//! - A tab reaches the first stop past where it starts, or the one after if
//!   that is nearer than half a space.
//! - With `tab-size: 0` a tab is as wide as its letter-spacing, which may be
//!   negative.
//!
//! Chrome snaps a tab's width up onto layout's grid (`SnappedWidth`), and so
//! does this. Nothing here panics: bad sizes and positions saturate.
