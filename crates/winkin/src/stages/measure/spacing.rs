//! Letter- and word-spacing: the room added after a cluster.
//!
//! The room depends only on the cluster, its style and the build's
//! [`WordSpacingRule`], so it goes into the prefix before any width is known.
//! [`LetterWordSpacing::after`] decides it. The measure scan adds it to the
//! prefix, and the breaker adds it to a line edge it reshapes with the same
//! rule, so a reshaped piece is spaced exactly as the paragraph was.
//!
//! The rules follow Chrome's `ShapeResultSpacing::ComputeSpacing`:
//! - `letter-spacing` goes after every cluster that draws, once per ligature.
//!   Zero-width characters, U+FFFC and tabs take none.
//! - No letter-spacing goes after a cluster of a cursive script, as CSS Text
//!   3, section 7.2.1 allows and Chrome 153 does (probe `joining`).
//! - `word-spacing` goes after U+0020 and U+00A0, but not after a U+0020
//!   that starts the block's text unless the block keeps its spaces. With
//!   [`WordSeparators`](crate::config::WordSpacing::WordSeparators) it goes after every separator
//!   in CSS Text 3's list, the first included.
//! - A percentage of either is of the style's own computed font size, as in
//!   CSS Text 4 and Chrome 153, not of the space's advance.
//!
//! Both round to 16.16, as Chrome's `TextRunLayoutUnit` does, and saturate.
