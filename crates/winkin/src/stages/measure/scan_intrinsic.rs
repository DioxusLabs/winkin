/// The intrinsic widths, added up as the scan goes: the widest min-content

/// - **Fitting:** every width is read as fitting reads it, from the
///   paragraph's start, each end rounded up to the grid. A min-content line
///   ends after the closing edges at its break and before what hangs at its
///   end. What hangs is taken off by the clusters' own advances. So a box
///   closing after a hanging space still counts, while the space doesn't.
/// - **Tabs:** a tab takes nothing in the prefix, so each is sized where it
///   lands and added. For max-content it lands on the paragraph's line, from
///   its start at the content edge. For min-content it lands on its own
///   min-content line, from that line's start, as Chrome's breaker sets it
///   in min-content mode. A tab that hangs comes off as a hanging space
///   does.
/// - **Hanging:** a min-content line leaves out everything it ends with that
///   hangs. A paragraph leaves out its trailing white space only where all
///   of it hangs. White space that is kept and wraps (`pre-wrap`) hangs only
///   where it overflows, and a max-content line has room for it, so it
///   counts (CSS Text 3, "white-space processing"). Kept white space that
///   doesn't wrap (`pre`) never hangs, so it counts in both. The white space
///   that ends the run decides for all of it, as it does for a line the
///   breaker ends there. A punctuation mark that hangs comes off where the
///   line-edge costs say: under `first`, `last` and `force-end` from both
///   sizes, under `allow-end` from min-content alone (CSS Text 4, "hanging
///   glyphs").
/// - **Line edges:** each line pays the line-edge costs at its ends: a
///   cloned box's edges where it starts or ends inside one, and the line
///   padding. A min-content line pays them at each of its ends. A paragraph
///   pays them at forced breaks and the text's ends.
/// - **Indent:** `text-indent` moves where a line starts. A paragraph is a
///   max-content line, so the block's first is indented, and every one under
///   `each-line`. A min-content line is indented where it is the block's
///   first, or under `each-line` its paragraph's first. `hanging` inverts
///   both. A tab lands past the indent of its line.
