//! `text-autospace`: the room added where an ideograph meets a narrow letter
//! or digit, as Chrome's `TextAutoSpace::Apply` adds it.
//!
//! The room is an eighth of the ideograph advance and goes after the cluster
//! before the seam. A seam reaches across items and box edges. An atomic
//! inline, a float, a forced break or a `unicode-bidi` box ends it, since
//! Chrome writes each as a character. A line ending at a seam gives the room
//! back (`UnapplyAutoSpacing`), even where Chrome keeps it after a
//! right-to-left item.
//!
//! Where the side before a seam reads right to left and the side after reads
//! left to right, Chrome writes the room before the later item's first
//! glyph. The prefix still holds it before the boundary. Line layout draws it
//! with the later text instead ([`AutospaceRules::room_before`]), so it
//! stands on that text's side of the right-to-left run.
//!
//! The measure scan finds seams with [`Seams`]; the breaker asks about one
//! line edge with [`AutospaceRules::gap_after`], and about each cluster of a
//! reshaped piece with [`AutospaceRules::gap_after_near`]. Each sizes the
//! room with [`AutospaceRules::gap`]. A seam inside one cluster is not looked
//! for.
