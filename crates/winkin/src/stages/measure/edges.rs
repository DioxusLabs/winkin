/// is no part of a line's end, nor is any opening after a forced break, as
/// `HandleForcedLineBreak` takes only the close tags right after it.
///
/// An absolutely positioned box's anchor ends the line before only ahead of
/// the boundary's first opening. Chrome's breaker may break after it there,
/// since it takes the break opportunity of the item before it
/// (`HandleOutOfFlowPositioned`). Elsewhere it starts the line after with
/// everything after it, or with the box it is in, as `RewindOverflow` holds
/// it untrailable. Where the line's trailing white space overflows, line
/// layout moves the anchors that end the line to the next
