//! Ruby columns and emphasis marks: the parts that don't depend on the
//! width.
//!
//! **A ruby column** is a base and the annotations set beside it, one level
//! each. It is sized once, as Chrome's `HandleRuby` sizes a column while it
//! breaks a line. It is as wide as the widest of its base and its levels,
//! each measured as a line of its own at its max-content.
//! - A wider annotation leaves room around and inside the base.
//!   `ruby-align` places that room, as Chrome's `ApplyRubyAlign` does.
//! - Some of the room may reach over the text beside the column, as
//!   `ruby-overhang` and `Config::ruby_overhang` say.
//! - The prefix holds what the column takes along the line. Line layout
//!   spreads the room from the insets kept here. The breaker reads how far
//!   the annotations reach across the line from the em boxes kept here.
//!
//! **An emphasis mark** is set like an annotation of its character, in the
//! same font at half the size (CSS Text Decoration 4, "emphasis marks"). Its
//! em box is the font's, normalized to half the computed size, and rounded
//! as Chrome rounds the size of the font it draws marks in
//! (`SimpleFontData::EmphasisMarkFontData`). Each row of text facts that
//! sets marks has one, in `TextMetrics::mark`.
//!
//! Nothing here allocates: the columns and their levels go into the stage's
//! tables, which keep their capacity.
