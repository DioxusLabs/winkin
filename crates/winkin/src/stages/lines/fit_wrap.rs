//! `text-wrap-style: balance` and `pretty`: a driver over the greedy fit, a
//! paragraph at a time.
//!
//! **Greedy first.** Each paragraph is laid out greedily, with floats, the
//! initial letter, the first line's variant and a clamp. Those lines stay
//! unless something better is found, so a fine paragraph costs one layout.
//! Otherwise the lines are taken back, with the host's floats, and laid out
//! again. A paragraph is the lines between forced breaks, balanced
//! separately as CSS Text 4 says. Chrome balances only a block's first
//! paragraph, which is not copied.
//!
//! **`balance`**, as Chrome does it:
//! - Where the greedy lines are six or fewer and their rooms don't depend on
//!   where they break, the scorer evens their slack over the same count.
//!   That needs no float anchored in them, no first-line variant, and a
//!   searched prefix.
//! - Otherwise, or where the scorer finds nothing, the room is halved down
//!   to the narrowest that holds the paragraph in as many lines. It starts
//!   from four fifths of the lines' average and stops at a pixel, as in
//!   Chrome's `ParagraphLineBreaker`.
//! - Beyond Chrome, halving has no line limit and runs beside floats. Every
//!   band is narrowed alike, so each line leaves even room, as CSS Text 4's
//!   "remaining space" says. The initial letter's lines are scored too.
//! - Each trial is a whole greedy layout, taken back. A pixel's precision
//!   takes at most 25 trials.
//!
//! **`pretty`**: the scorer weighs a paragraph's last lines where the last
//! one ends short. Chrome's rule weighs four lines. It calls a line short
//! when it is one word under a third of its room, or the two lines before it
//! are hyphenated. `Pretty::Even` weighs six, and also counts any last line
//! under a fifth. The count of lines stays as the greedy fit made it.
//!
//! **A plan is followed while it fits.** A line the scorer ended is fitted
//! to that end and measured like any candidate. If it no longer fits, the
//! rest of the paragraph is fitted greedily. That happens when a float lands
//! elsewhere, a taller line meets another band, or a reshaped edge is wider.
