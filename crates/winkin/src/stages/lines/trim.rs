//! What `text-box-trim` takes off a block's first and last lines.
//!
//! Breaking stacks the lines by these amounts, and the block result reports
//! them. The rules follow Chrome's `InlineLayoutAlgorithm::ApplyTextBoxTrim`
//! and `InlineBoxState::AdjustEdges`:
//! - The first line is trimmed by its ascent less the block's over edge.
//! - The last line is trimmed by its descent less the under edge.
//! - Each edge is measured from the baseline in the block's primary font.
//! - An amount may be negative. A line box shorter than its text, under a
//!   small `line-height`, moves the first line down and the block's end out.
//! - In `vertical-lr`, where lines flip, the start is a line's under side,
//!   as Chrome's `is_flipped_line` swaps them. `sideways-lr` trims as a
//!   horizontal block does, as Chrome 153 does.
