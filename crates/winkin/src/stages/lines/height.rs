//! How tall a line is: its line box's extent, and the baseline shifts only
//! the line can settle.
//!
//! The extent is the union, from the strut, of what is on the line:
//! - every item's extent, where its box's baseline puts it;
//! - the strut of every box open across the line's start, as Blink's
//!   `OnBeginPlaceItems` keeps an open box's `text_metrics` for the next
//!   line.
//!
//! Where nothing is shifted, every baseline is the line's and the union is
//! flat. The boxes open across the start come from `carried_struts`, which
//! walks up few boxes and keeps a record where a line starts inside many.
//! A line then costs its own items however deep the boxes nest.
//!
//! Where something is shifted, the line is walked as Blink's
//! `InlineLayoutStateStack` walks it. Each open box unites what it holds
//! around its own baseline and applies its shift when it closes, as
//! `ApplyBaselineShift` does. Measurement holds the shifts that do not
//! depend on the line. This module settles the rest:
//! - `middle` centres the box's extent on its parent's baseline raised by
//!   half the parent's x-height.
//! - `text-top` and `text-bottom` wait for the parent to close. They set the
//!   box's top on the top of the parent's unleaded text, or its bottom on
//!   the bottom.
//! - `top` and `bottom` wait for the nearest `top` or `bottom` box around
//!   them, or the line. They are settled last, against its aligned subtree:
//!   everything it holds but the `top` and `bottom` boxes and their content.
//!   A taller pinned box grows the subtree's other edge, as Blink's
//!   `MetricsForTopAndBottomAlign` does. The whole subtree moves with its
//!   box.
//!
//! The settled shifts go in `shifts`, a line's together and sorted by node.
//! Line layout adds them to measurement's and places everything once.
//!
//! Two of Blink's ways break CSS 2.1 for `top` and `bottom`, so this module
//! follows CSS: a `top` box inside a raised span lands on the line's top,
//! and a box inside a `top` box does not grow the line it is pinned to.
//!
//! Nothing here allocates once warm. Any nesting depth is walked without
//! recursion. Each box links the boxes waiting for it, so settling never
//! looks at another box's.
