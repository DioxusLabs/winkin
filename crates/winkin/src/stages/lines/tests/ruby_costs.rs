//! Cost tests of long ruby columns split across many lines. They pin:
//! - the steps and seeks a relayout takes a line, the same for a column 1,
//!   2, 4 and 8 times as long;
//! - that bound with annotations longer and shorter than their base, under
//!   both `RubyBreakWithin` settings, and with ruby nested in the base;
//! - annotations of many boxes, one a word.
//!
//! Steps and seeks are counted only in debug builds.
