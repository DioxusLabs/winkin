//! Shaping a line's unsafe edges again, as more of [`Breaker`]'s `impl`.
//!
//! **Unsafe edges.** A line starting at a cluster the font shaped across is
//! reshaped up to the next safe-to-break cluster, at most to its shaping
//! run's end, as Chrome's `ShapingLineBreaker` does.
//! - A line ending at one is reshaped from the last safe start before it.
//!   The piece widens where its own start may not join, but never past its
//!   shaping run's start.
//! - A candidate is measured with its pieces. A reshape that makes it too
//!   wide sends the search to the opportunity before, as Chrome's
//!   `ShapingLineBreaker::ShapeLine` does.
//! - A break at a space is not reshaped at the line's end unless alignment
//!   needs the exact end (Chrome's `SetDontReshapeEndIfAtSpace`).
//!
//! **A seam's room given back** (`text-autospace`). A line ending where
//! `text-autospace` puts room before the next cluster gives the room back.
//! Its last cluster becomes a piece copied from the paragraph's glyphs, with
//! the room taken off its advance. A reshaped end simply adds no room after
//! it. This matches Chrome's `UnapplyAutoSpacing` and
//! `AdjustOffsetForAutoSpacing`.
//!
//! **Punctuation trimmed at a line's edges** (`text-spacing-trim`). A line
//! reshaped at its start is shaped as a start, so an opening mark is not
//! kerned against the line before. Under `space-first` and `trim-start`, a
//! line wrapping to an opening mark is always reshaped there, with the mark
//! trimmed, as Chrome's `FirstSafeOffset` does. A closing mark that fits
//! only trimmed ends the line trimmed, where a break after it is allowed, as
//! Chrome's `ShapeLine` does.
