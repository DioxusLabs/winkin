//! The scorer of `text-wrap-style: balance` and `pretty`, as Blink's
//! `ScoreLineBreaker` after Minikin's `OptimalLineBreaker`.
//!
//! It chooses the ends of a window of a paragraph's lines. Each line scores
//! the room it leaves squared, plus what its end costs.
//!
//! Every place a line may end, a [`BreakCandidate`], is measured once from
//! the paragraph's prefix. A line between two candidates is then one
//! subtraction. The best way to each candidate is the best way to an
//! earlier one plus the line between. The window is a few lines: six for
//! `balance` and four for `pretty`, as in Chrome, and six for `Pretty::Even`
//! (beyond Chrome). So the pass costs what Chrome's does.
//!
//! The rules differ in what the last line costs:
//! - Under `balance` its slack counts like any line's, so the lines come out
//!   as even as the count allows.
//! - Under `pretty` its slack counts nothing. Only a line that leaves the
//!   last word alone pays, Blink's orphan penalty.
//! - `Pretty::Even` (beyond Chrome) also makes a last line under a fifth of
//!   its room cost more than any other choice. The lines before then give it
//!   the words it needs.
