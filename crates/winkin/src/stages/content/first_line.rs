//! The first paragraph as its first line draws it, where a first-line
//! transform differs from a node's own.
//!
//! The content's text holds each node's own transform, which every line but
//! the first shows and every stage reads. Where the block's `::first-line`
//! gives a node another transform, the first line draws other characters.
//! `FirstLineSource` holds them: the first paragraph's text with each such
//! node's text transformed as its first-line style says. It also holds a
//! map from the content's offsets to its own. The first-line measurements
//! use the map to read each cluster's characters by its content offsets.
//!
//! The writer keeps it in step with the text as it writes. From the first
//! text a first-line transform changes, it writes everything here too: the
//! same text where no transform differs, and the first line's transform of
//! the caller's text where one does. It also makes the same edits
//! collapsing makes: a space written where its run began, and the block's
//! leading and trailing trim. It stops where the first paragraph ends, since
//! no first line reaches past it. A document whose first line transforms
//! nothing its own way keeps nothing here.
//!
//! **The map** is a list of entries ([`MapEntry`]), sorted by content offset,
//! each running to the next. Before the first entry the two texts are the
//! same.
//! - In an aligned entry the two texts match byte for byte. They do
//!   wherever the transforms agree, or change a character for one of the
//!   same length.
//! - An entry that is not aligned is one of the caller's characters that
//!   the two transforms made differently long (`ß` in capitals is `SS` in
//!   the text and itself on the first line). It maps as a whole: an offset
//!   inside it goes to its end. So the first cluster it holds draws all of
//!   it and the rest draw nothing, as a ligature's continuations do.
//! - Where the two transforms do not map the caller's characters one for
//!   one, as a Greek accent dropped in context can, the whole run of text
//!   is one entry that is not aligned.
