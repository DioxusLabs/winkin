//! White space collapsing: one state machine with one transition function.
//!
//! The writer classifies each character by its node's
//! `white-space-collapse` and hands the collapser an [`Event`].
//! [`Collapser::step`] moves the state and says what, if anything, the
//! writer must write. The collapser holds no text and touches none. It is a
//! pure function of the events, so it can be tested apart from the writer.
//!
//! The rules follow Chrome's reading of CSS Text 3, section 4.1.1:
//!
//! - A run of collapsible white space becomes one space, **where the run
//!   began**, even across box edges and ruby marks. The space is written
//!   once something follows the run, so a run that ends the block, or meets
//!   a forced break, writes nothing.
//! - **Atomic inlines end a run; floats, box edges, ruby marks and `<wbr>`
//!   do not.** They are opaque to collapsing (Blink's `kOpaqueToCollapsing`),
//!   so the writer does not tell the collapser about them at all.
//! - **A wrap opportunity survives collapsing.** When white space from a node
//!   that wraps joins a run that began in one that does not, a break
//!   opportunity is generated where it joined (Blink's
//!   `AppendGeneratedBreakOpportunity`).
//! - **A forced break removes the collapsible white space on both sides.**
//!   Forced breaks are a `<br>`, a kept segment break, and a character that
//!   forces a line break in every mode (VT, FF, NEL, U+2028, U+2029; CSS
//!   Text 3, section 5.1).
//! - **Segment breaks** become a space, unless the run's neighbour on either
//!   side is U+200B (Blink's `ShouldRemoveNewline`). Chrome compiles out the
//!   East Asian Width rule of CSS Text 3, section 4.1.2, so this crate does
//!   too.
//! - **Nothing collapsible is written at the block's start**, nor after a
//!   forced break.
//! - **`white-space-trim`** acts on the pending run at box edges, beyond
//!   Chrome. The writer handles the block's own `discard-inner`, since it
//!   trims kept white space too.
//! - **A combined unit** (`text-combine-upright: all`) collapses its white
//!   space on its own, as Chrome's `LayoutTextCombine` is an inline block
//!   with its own text. Nothing collapsible is written at its start or end.
//!   Outside, it is content, as an atomic inline is.
