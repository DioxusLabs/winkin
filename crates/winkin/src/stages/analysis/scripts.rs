//! Script resolution and the runs.
//!
//! A cluster's script is its first character's, resolved as UAX #24 and
//! Blink's `ScriptRunIterator` resolve it:
//!
//! - **Common, Inherited and Unknown** take the preceding real script, or at
//!   a run's start the following one. The runs are held in scratch until
//!   their script is known, so this is one look-ahead, not a second pass.
//! - **Script_Extensions** narrow a shared character toward its neighbour: a
//!   character that may be Hiragana, Katakana or Han stays in a Han run, and
//!   characters that may each be several scripts keep the scripts they all
//!   share. One that fits neither side starts a run of its own.
//! - **Paired brackets** take the script of their opener, so the closing
//!   parenthesis after Japanese quoted in English is English.
//!
//! As in Blink, the resolution runs over the whole text, across paragraphs:
//! a paragraph of digits after a paragraph of Han is Han, which is the script
//! font fallback then asks for. The runs themselves never cross a paragraph.
