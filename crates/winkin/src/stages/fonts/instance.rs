//! Font instances, kept in the context across layouts.
//!
//! An instance holds everything apart from size that makes two runs shape
//! differently: a font ([`FontKey`]) at a point in its design space, with its
//! synthesis, its OpenType features and its `@font-face` metric descriptors.
//! It holds its record ([`UsedInstance`]) and the font's unscaled metrics at
//! its coordinates, both made when the instance is. A used font shares the
//! record and scales the metrics to its size.
//!
//! **A face** is a font held whole at its default coordinates. Every
//! instance of the font is cut from its [`Face`]
//! (`Font::instance_builder`), so they share one reading of its tables,
//! harfrust's included. The feature offers and coverages read the face too.
//! A face counts the instances cut from it, and goes at the first trim
//! after the last one does, which releases its bytes.
//!
//! **An instance is found without reading a byte.** Its key is what was
//! asked of the font: [`fontwich::Font::key`], the merged variation settings
//! in user space, the synthesis, the resolved features and the metric
//! overrides. The coordinates are normalized once, when the instance is
//! made. Two keys that normalize alike cost an extra cache entry, never a
//! wrong answer. No layout holds an [`InstanceId`].
//!
//! **Variations** merge by tag, the later winning, in Chrome's order (Blink's
//! `FontCustomPlatformData`, measured against Chrome 153):
//! 1. the axes font matching sets for weight, width and style ([`Synthesis`]);
//! 2. the `@font-face` descriptor's `font-variation-settings`;
//! 3. the element's `font-variation-settings`;
//! 4. `opsz` at the used size under `font-optical-sizing: auto`, where
//!    neither setting names `opsz`.
//!
//! A platform font may take the matching axes alone, as Chrome on Windows and
//! Linux leaves its variations to the platform
//! ([`PlatformFontVariations`]).
