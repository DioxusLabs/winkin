//! What font selection keeps between layouts.
//!
//! Everything here is keyed by content, never by a width or a first-line
//! cut, so every layout the context serves shares it. The keys are what a
//! family list names, a run's script and language, and a style's matching
//! attributes. There are five caches, each a type of its own:
//! - the **named** and **candidate lists** (`lists`): the families and fonts
//!   to try, in order, and the characters no font maps;
//! - **instances** (`instance`), keyed by font, variations and features,
//!   with the faces they are cut from;
//! - **offers** (`features`): which synthesized features a font offers
//!   under a script;
//! - **feature coverages** (`positions`): what a font's `sups` or `subs`
//!   covers under a script.
//!
//! The candidate lists hold fontwich family handles, so a collection change
//! drops them. The instances and faces of fonts the new collection lacks go
//! too, which releases their bytes. The rest are keyed by names or by the
//! bytes' id, which fontwich keeps stable. A cache whose ids are all taken,
//! which takes four billion live entries, starts again rather than
//! panicking.
//!
//! **All of it is a cache.** No layout holds an id into it, since a layout's
//! used fonts share what they shape and draw with. So any of it may be
//! dropped between calls, and the next build finds or makes it again. Each
//! cache keeps at most its capacity: [`FontContext::trim`] drops the entries
//! used longest ago before every build, when no id is held.
