//! A used font's line metrics.
//!
//! Font selection computes them once per used font, when it first uses an
//! instance at a size. They come from the instance's unscaled metrics, the
//! size and the context's [`Config`](crate::config::Config), whose
//! [`LineMetricsSource`] picks which set of vertical metrics measures a line.
//! The ascent, descent and line gap are rounded to whole pixels, as Windows
//! hands them to Chrome and as Skia rounds them everywhere. No other code
//! computes metrics.
//!
//! A metric the font does not give takes a default, so that a font with
//! broken tables, and a used font with no font at all, still measure:
//!
//! | Metric | Default |
//! |---|---|
//! | ascent, descent, line gap | 0.8, 0.2 and 0 em |
//! | x-height | the top of `x`, else 0.56 × the ascent, as Blink estimates it |
//! | cap height | the top of `H`, else 0.7 em |
//! | em box | the typographic pair scaled to one em, else the line's ascent and descent so scaled, else all above |
//! | ideographic baseline | the descent, rounded: the em box's bottom |
//! | central baseline | the middle of the ascent and descent |
//! | mathematical baseline | half the x-height up |
//! | hanging baseline | 0.8 of the ascent up |
//! | underline, strikeout | none: no thickness, which the painter reads as `auto`'s |
//! | superscript, subscript | 0.34 em up, 0.22 em down |
//! | ideographic advance | 水's advance, else one em |
//!
//! A decoration line the font gives is at least a pixel thick.
//!
//! **A vertical line is centred.** Where the block's lines run down the page
//! with their text upright or mixed, the dominant baseline is the central
//! one, as Blink's `ComputedStyle::GetFontBaseline` has it ([`LineBaseline`]).
//! Every font of the layout is then measured about it:
//! - its line's height, in whole pixels, splits with the odd pixel over, as
//!   `FontMetrics::IntAscentInternal(kCentralBaseline)` splits it;
//! - its em box is the size on the grid halved, as
//!   `NormalizedTypoAscentAndDescent` halves it;
//! - every baseline and decoration line, the alphabetic one included, is an
//!   offset from the central baseline.
//!
//! This module also reads how far a glyph's ink reaches, which an initial
//! letter is fitted to ([`UsedFonts::glyph_ink`]).
