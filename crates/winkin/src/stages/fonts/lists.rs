//! The context's family lists: two tables, each with a hash index over it.
//!
//! - [`NamedLists`] holds each distinct `font-family` list by its names, so
//!   a list keeps one id across layouts. It holds names, not families, so it
//!   survives a new collection.
//! - [`CandidateLists`] holds the families to try in CSS's order, per list,
//!   script, language, matching request and presentation. Their fonts are
//!   matched a family at a time as the walk reaches each, so no family loads
//!   before a cluster needs it. Beside the lists it keeps the characters no
//!   font maps.
//!
//! Each list is made whole from fontwich's answers the first time a segment
//! asks for it, and grows only at its end.
