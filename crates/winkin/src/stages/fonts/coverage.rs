//! Whether a font covers a cluster, and which presentation a cluster asks for.
//!
//! **Coverage is all or nothing per cluster.** A font covers a cluster where
//! harfrust, shaping the cluster in it, draws no `.notdef`. Three tests ask
//! this against fontwich's [`Charset`], each only where the one before cannot
//! say:
//! - **As written:** every character is mapped, or is a default-ignorable
//!   that harfrust hides ([`is_default_ignorable`]). Each
//!   candidate keeps the last [`CharsetPage`] it found, so most characters
//!   cost one bit test.
//! - **A lone character with no decomposition:** harfrust draws it only by
//!   faking it ([`faked_from`]). This catches every ideograph a Latin font
//!   sends to fallback in one lookup.
//! - **harfrust's normalizer** (`_hb_ot_shape_normalize`), replayed against
//!   the charset in its three rounds: decompose, reorder marks, recompose.
//!   A cluster the font draws in a mix of forms is covered. For example, `ǘ`
//!   in a font with `ü` and U+0301 but neither `ǘ` nor U+0308 draws as `ü`
//!   and U+0301. Hangul follows harfrust's Hangul shaper instead.
//!
//! The replay skips the Indic, Khmer, Myanmar, USE and Hebrew shapers' own
//! compositions and the Thai shaper's sara am. It allocates nothing: a
//! cluster of more than [`MAX_NORMALIZED_CHARS`] characters is tested as
//! written only.
//!
//! **A variation sequence** is covered as its base, since harfrust draws the
//! base where the font lacks the sequence. Cluster matching asks
//! [`has_sequences`] in Blink's two passes: first the first font with every
//! sequence of the cluster, then the first font that covers it.
