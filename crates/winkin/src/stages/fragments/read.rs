//! Reads a text item back: its placed glyphs and its clusters' advances.
//!
//! The layout's `TextRun` wraps these walks, and the tests read positions
//! through them.
//!
//! **Where a glyph stands:** the item's exact `inline`, plus the exact
//! advances of the clusters before it, plus the glyph's own offsets.
//! - A cluster's advance is its prefix step, so its left is one subtraction
//!   from its prefix entry. A paint walk reads a word and a sum per glyph.
//! - Where reshaped line edges hold some clusters, their advances and
//!   glyphs come from the reshaped pieces, walked with a running sum. The
//!   paragraph's glyphs are never read for a reshaped cluster.
//! - Right to left, clusters are drawn from the item's right end back. Their
//!   glyphs are already in drawing order.
//!
//! **A glyph's advance** is the shaper's, except a cluster's last glyph,
//! which takes the rest of the cluster's advance. So the glyphs add up to
//! the cluster, spacing and justification included, as Chrome adds letter
//! spacing and justification room to a cluster's last glyph.
//!
//! **On a justified line** a cluster's advance adds `per` for each of its
//! opportunities, counted by the same rule line layout used. The last
//! opportunity also takes the leftover. A cluster with an opportunity before
//! it moves its glyphs by that room, as Chrome offsets an ideograph after a
//! letter. The line's record is found by search; nothing is stored per
//! cluster.
//!
//! **No item searches for its run or items.** Its record names its shaping
//! run and its content item, and its line names its paragraph.
//!
//! **An item's advance** is the same sum over all its clusters, stored on
//! the item. The walks add up to it, and a right-to-left walk starts from
//! it.
//!
//! Nothing is allocated and nothing restarts. Each walk holds a few words of
//! state and hands out each glyph or cluster once.
//!
//! **A ruby annotation's text** is on a line of its own, and the prefix sums
//! give it nothing. Its clusters step by their glyphs' own advances, which
//! shaping keeps for it, plus spacing, with a running sum.
