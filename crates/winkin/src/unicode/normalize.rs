//! What font coverage asks of canonical normalization: the steps harfrust's
//! normalizer takes, a character or a pair at a time, and the properties it
//! takes them by.
//!
//! The first three are HarfBuzz's unicode functions in their own shape:
//! `hb_unicode_decompose`, `hb_unicode_compose` and
//! `hb_unicode_combining_class`. They are pairwise steps, and a normalizer
//! to NFD or NFC is a loop over them. harfrust exposes its own since 0.14.0
//! (`harfrust::unicode`), over the tables its normalizer reads, so coverage
//! answers from the shaper's data by construction.
//!
//! Those tables are Unicode 18.0, where ICU 2.3's are 17.0. They have the
//! same decompositions and compositions, plus 37 marks Unicode 18 assigns,
//! 34 with a combining class, which ICU leaves unassigned. The tests check
//! the three against ICU's NFD and NFC over every character, every pair
//! that composes, a random corpus and Unicode's `NormalizationTest.txt`.
//! They check the classes against ICU's except for those 34.
//!
//! The rest are HarfBuzz's own rules, not Unicode's: the combining classes
//! it reorders marks by, its default-ignorables and its variation
//! selectors. harfrust (0.14.0, the workspace's) keeps these private, so
//! this module copies them, since coverage has to agree with it. Whether a
//! character is a mark, General_Category Mn, Mc or Me, comes from this
//! crate's own table ([`CoreProps::is_mark`](super::CoreProps::is_mark)).
//!
//! Nothing here allocates or panics, whatever the character.
