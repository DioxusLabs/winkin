//! The system layer on Windows: DirectWrite's fonts.
//!
//! The shape fontique's DirectWrite backend has, and for the same reason:
//! DirectWrite lists every family name in the system collection at once, so
//! the layer's name set is complete from the start and no font file is read. A
//! family's files are asked for the first time its fonts are wanted.
//!
//! The layer's fallback source is the Windows tables, which is what fallback on
//! Windows has always been; DirectWrite is asked only what is installed.
