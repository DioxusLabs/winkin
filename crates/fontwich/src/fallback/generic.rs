//! The CSS generic families, and Chrome's font settings they read.
//!
//! A `Generic(family, bucket)` key resolves, as in Chrome, to the first
//! installed family of an ordered list. Each platform's backend holds its
//! lists in a [`GenericTable`]. This module holds what every platform
//! shares: which generics exist, the setting each reads, and how a bucket
//! with no value of its own takes Common's.
//!
//! Chrome reads a generic from its font setting for the generic and the
//! content locale's script (`FontSelector::FamilyNameFromSettings`,
//! `font_selector.cc:71–90`), whose defaults are fixed per platform build:
//!
//! - a value is a default only where `kFontDefaults` registers it
//!   (`prefs_tab_helper.cc:147–222`); every other script's setting is empty
//!   and takes Common's (`GenericFontFamilySettings::GenericFontFamilyForScript`,
//!   `generic_font_family_settings.cc:81–108`);
//! - a value starting with `,` is a list, resolved to its first installed
//!   family (`gfx::FontList::FirstAvailableOrFirst`,
//!   `prefs_tab_helper.cc:447–450`), so the whole list is kept in order.
//!
//! Separately, Chrome tries the content locale's **Standard** font after
//! every `font-family` list, before system fallback
//! (`font_fallback_list.cc:177–187`): [`GenericTable::standard`].
//!
//! **Not modelled: the browser's UI language.** Chrome drops the default
//! for the script of its UI locale (`prefs_tab_helper.cc:430–441`), and the
//! Common values are translated per UI locale
//! (`platform_locale_settings/locale_settings_*_<lang>.xtb`). The tables
//! are an English UI's. A host whose users run Chrome in another language
//! supplies that difference itself.

// A build with no backend reads no table: only the key's folding is left.
