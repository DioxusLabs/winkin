//! A missed character's own key: what a character no family of its run maps
//! asks before the Common key.
//!
//! - **Emoji.** A character with the Emoji property asks an emoji key: the
//!   color fonts where it is emoji by default (Emoji_Presentation) or a
//!   selector asks for them (VS16), the text emoji fonts otherwise (VS15, or a
//!   symbol such as `☺` in text). A character without the property, such as
//!   `★`, ignores its selector.
//! - **Its script.** The Script property's, with the fullwidth forms
//!   U+FF01–FF5E as Han. Han and the kana, hangul and bopomofo keys take
//!   their tradition as [`FallbackKey::new`] gives it.
//! - **A shared character** (Common or Inherited) asks one of its
//!   Script_Extensions: `。` Han in the page's tradition, `ー` Japanese, `।`
//!   Devanagari. Without any, a math alphanumeric asks the math key and a
//!   symbol the symbol key.
//!
//! Anything else asks nothing of its own and goes to the Common key, which on
//! Windows ends with Chrome's catch-all lists (`platform::windows::tail`).
//!
//! This follows Chrome where that is cheap and differs where Chrome needs a
//! table per block: Windows' block rule sends arrows and math operators to
//! Cambria Math and `①` reaches MS PGothic through `kCommonFonts`, where
//! here both ask the symbol key; and Linux walks the page language's whole
//! list for shared punctuation, which this answers from the character's
//! scripts' lists instead.
